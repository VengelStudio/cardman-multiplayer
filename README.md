### We decided to make a combination of traditional hangman game and a card game.

The primary goal is to guess the letters of a random word, but during your turn you can also use awesome cards from your deck to help yourself. These cards can give you some serious advantage over your opponent.

### Available cards:

-   Show definition

-   Correct letter

-   Additional turn

-   Block opponent's cards

-   Immune to block

-   Look up opponent's card

-   Swap a random card with your opponent

-   Randomize your card

-   Randomize opponent's card
